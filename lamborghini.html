            <h1>Lamborghini Miura</h1>
            <p> The car was the first supercar with a rear mid-engined two-seat layout, although the concept was first seen in a production road car with René Bonnet's Matra Djet, introduced in 1964. This layout has since become the standard for high-performance sports and supercars. When released, it was the fastest production road car.

            The Miura was originally conceived by Lamborghini's engineering team, which designed the car in its spare time against the wishes[citation needed] of company founder Ferruccio Lamborghini, who preferred powerful yet sedate grand touring cars over the race car-derived machines produced by local rival Ferrari.</p>
