                    <p>Updates for 2021: Audi has announced that the R8 will be permanently available in rear-wheel drive configuration going forward. The rear-wheel drive R8 takes its place in the lineup as the entry-level R8 variant; if you want Quattro, you will have to opt for the Performance model.</p>
                    <p>The Audi R8 underwent a facelift recently. It now has more aggressive styling. It's the best looking the R8 has ever been. The front fascia is different and it has new side skirts, a new rear bumper, new rear diffuser, and a new spoiler. Inside, the cabin looks more or less the same.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to the rear-wheel drive now being the standard offering, the base price of the car is almost $30,000 lower than the previous year - making the Audi R8 as attractive a buy, as perhaps it has ever been.</p>

                    <p>As the first electric SUV built with Audi DNA, the e-tron速 offers ample interior space for everyday trips, long-range capability, and quattro速 all-wheel drive performance. The Audi e-tron GT is a modern-day demonstration of progress. It simultaneously radiates sportiness, high quality, and comfort.</p>
                    <p>The 2021 Audi e-tron might not be able to boast the range capabilities of a Tesla, nor the overall performance of a Porsche Taycan. However, it's comfortable, fashionable, and has all the right gear to help make the transition from gas to electric, a desirably non-eventful endeavour. It even has a 4,000 lbs towing capacity, which no other passenger EV can match right now. This makes it a very important player in the lead up to Audi's all-out-electrification strategy.</p>

                <p>The RS 7 Sportback is what you get when you take the RS 6 Avant's engine, then place it in a sleeker Audi Sportback frame. The resulting Audi RS 7 Sportback is an aggressive and beautiful car, with the specs to back up its appearance. This strikingly athletic, yet elegant, four-door sports car is the perfect blend of practicality and performance.</p>
                <p>At the heart of the car is the twin-turbocharged 4.0L V8 engine with a mild-hybrid system, that puts out a whopping 591 hp and 590 lb-ft of torque. The results are impressive, too - the car can sprint from 0-62 mph in just 3.6 seconds, on its way to a top speed of 155 mph.</p>
